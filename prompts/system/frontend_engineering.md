# Frontend Engineering Super Prompt

Design and develop a frontend interface that reflects the quality, structure, and design principles of a Microsoft-engineered product. The UI should follow Microsoft's design language (similar to Fluent Design), emphasizing clarity, accessibility, performance, and responsiveness.

Use a clean layout, consistent spacing, professional typography, subtle animations, and a well-structured component architecture. Ensure the interface feels enterprise-grade, polished, and production-ready.

Focus on scalability, maintainable code structure, accessibility standards (ARIA, keyboard navigation), and cross-device compatibility. The final result should look modern, minimal, and professionally engineered at a Big Tech standard.

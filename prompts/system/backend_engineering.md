# Backend Engineering Super Prompt

Architect and implement the backend system as if it were designed by a senior LLM infrastructure expert from Anthropic, DeepMind, or OpenAI, in collaboration with senior platform engineers from Microsoft or Apple.

The backend should reflect world-class standards in scalability, security, reliability, and maintainability. Use clean architecture principles (layered or hexagonal architecture), strong typing, modular services, and clear separation of concerns.

Design for high availability, horizontal scalability, and production-grade performance. Include proper API design (REST or GraphQL), structured logging, observability (metrics, tracing), robust authentication/authorization, and enterprise-level security best practices.

Ensure the codebase is well-documented, testable (unit + integration tests), CI/CD ready, and cloud-native compatible. The system should demonstrate thoughtful handling of concurrency, data integrity, fault tolerance, and graceful error management.

The final backend should feel like it was built by engineers operating at top-tier AI labs and major global technology companies.

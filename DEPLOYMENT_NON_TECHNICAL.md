# Easy Deployment Guide (Simple Steps!)

Hello! This guide will help you set up your AI Trading Platform. We will use very simple steps. Think of it like building a Lego set!

## 🏠 Step 1: Get the House Ready
First, we need a "folder" where all the code will live.
1. Download the code from the internet.
2. Put the folder on your computer (like on your Desktop).

## 🔑 Step 2: Get the "Magic Keys"
The AI needs "keys" to talk to the brain.
1. Go to the websites for **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, and **Google**.
2. Get your "API Keys" (these are like secret passwords).
3. Open the file called `.env` in the `backend` folder.
4. Paste your keys where it says `API_KEY=`. **Do not show these keys to anyone!**

## 🐳 Step 3: Install the "Containers"
We use a tool called **Docker**. It's like a magic box that holds everything the platform needs.
1. Download and install **Docker Desktop** on your computer.
2. Open the Docker app.

## 🚀 Step 4: Press the "Magic Button"
Now, we tell the computer to start everything.
1. Open your "Terminal" (this is the black box where you type commands).
2. Go to the `backend` folder.
3. Type this magic command: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Wait for the computer to finish downloading. It might take a few minutes.

## 📊 Step 5: Check the Dashboard
Everything should be working now!
1. Open your web browser (like Chrome).
2. Type `http://localhost:3000` in the top bar.
3. You should see your beautiful Trading Dashboard!

## 🛑 Important Rules
- **Do not share your keys!** They are like your house keys.
- **Check your money.** Trading is real, so be careful!
- **Ask for help!** If something looks scary, ask a friend who knows computers.

That's it! You are now a 🚀 **Trading Platform Owner!**
